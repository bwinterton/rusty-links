# Rusty Links
Rusty links is an implementation of a linked list in Rust as a library. This
project sparked from my current desire to learn Rust better. I previously had
attempted another project in Rust that required a structure similar to a linked
list but had troubles fighting against the compiler with lifetimes. I am hoping
that this project will allow me to work out some of those problems in a more
simple fashion and allow me to learn how to handle these situations better.

Feel free to follow along with my progress! I don't currently have any plans to
publish this to crates.io or anything (I mean, come on, who needs a linked list
in their project?), but things could always change!

### Contributing
If you have a contribution that you feel would improve the quality of my library
please feel free to open a pull request. With your pull request please take the
time to explain the reasoning behind your change. As noted earlier, I am using
this library as a learning tool, so if I can do something better I would like to
know! Pull requests without explainations will probably not get accepted.
