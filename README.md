# Rusty Links
Rusty links is an implementation of a linked list in Rust as a library. This
project sparked from my current desire to learn Rust better. I previously had
attempted another project in Rust that required a structure similar to a linked
list but had troubles fighting against the compiler with lifetimes. I am hoping
that this project will allow me to work out some of those problems in a more
simple fashion and allow me to learn how to handle these situations better.

Feel free to follow along with my progress! I don't currently have any plans to
publish this to crates.io or anything (I mean, come on, who needs a linked list
in their project?), but things could always change!

I also want this project to serve as a learning resource for others who at some
point find themselves in the same boat that I was when I started this. So, I
will try to comment the code as well as I can and provide other learning
resources where necessary. I will also be linking any great resources that I
find along the way here for others to discover.

### Contributing
If you have a contribution that you feel would improve the quality of my library
please feel free to open a pull request. With your pull request please take the
time to explain the reasoning behind your change. As noted earlier, I am using
this library as a learning tool, so if I can do something better I would like to
know! Pull requests without explainations will probably not get accepted.

Also, if you have other suggestions in general (how to make the project a better
learning resource, how to find what I am looking for, how to deal with things in
a better way, etc.) please feel free to share! Opening issues on the project is
the best way to handle this so that I can keep things in the same place for
others to learn from in the future.
